Intelligent Vehicle Damage Assessment &amp; Cost Estimator for Insurance Companies Using IBM Cloud
Nowadays, the proliferation of automobile industries is directly related to the number of claims in insurance companies.
Those companies are facing many simultaneous claims and solving claims leakage. 
In Advanced Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning algorithms can help to solve these kinds of problems for insurance industries.
In this project, we apply deep learning-based algorithm, VGG16  for car damage detection and assessment in real world datasets. 
The algorithm detect the damaged part of a car, assess its  severity. Initially, we discover the effect of domain speciﬁc pre-trained CNN models, which are trained on using dataset. 
Then we apply transfer learning in pretrained VGG models and use some techniques to improve the accuracy of our system. After analyzing and implementing our models, we can ﬁnd out the Cost and we can estimate it results of a particular damage of vehicle.
